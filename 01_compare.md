<h2>CURR DEV Assignment 01_compare.md</h2>

<h3>In this assignment I will:</h3>

1. Identify two CS curriculums. 
2. Report significant differences between the two identified curriculums based on strengths & weakness.
3. Provide a commentary on whether a hierarchy in effectivity exists between the selected curriculums.
4. Discuss the potential for integration/adoption of aspects of the curriculums into classroom instruction and reasoning implementation of identified aspects.

<h3>PART 1</h3>
Curriculums to be compared with source hyperlinks:

<h4>(CS4ALL 3-4 Integrated Unit: Introduction to Programming Curriculum, CS4ALL IPC</h4> <h6>Source: https://blueprint.cs4all.nyc/curriculum/3-5-integrated-units</p>
<p>vs</p> 
<h4>Code.org's Express Course Curriculum, CODE.ORG ECC</h4> <h6>Source: https://studio.code.org/s/express-2022?section_id=3672315<h/6>

<h3>PART 2</h3>
<h4>STRENGTHS</h4>

<h4>CS4ALL IPC - Strengths</h4>
 <ul>  
  <li>Portable and easily accessible on multiple electronic device platforms, i.e. laptops, desktops, mobile devices and tablets.</li>
  <li>Has been created and vetted by teachers for successful implementation in a wide spectrum of NYCDOE instructional environments.</li>
  <li>Supports multiple learning styles in its execution, resources and assessments.</li>
  <li>Is updated annually to ensure that supplemental resources are current and accessible.</li>
  <li>Includes cross academic application opportunities.</li>
  <li>Lessons focused on building understandings of principles such as algorithmic understandings/debugging using visual block programming.</li>
  <li>Offers a range of assessments, that accommodate the differing abilities within a diverse population of students.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>CODE.ORG ECC - Strengths</h4>
 <ul> 
  <li>Multiple sensory instructional model available to support student knowledge and guide foundational understandings</li>
  <li>Student centered/driven instructional loci.</li>
  <li>Provides opportunities for cross academic applications.</li>
  <li>Assessments utilizing guiding principles of gamification.</li>
  <li>Student progress and workflow is digitally documented and progress reports are readily available.</li>
  <li>Assessments are engaging and includes challenges to raise the bar and truly assess student understandings.</li>
  <li>Uses visual block coding SNAP!- like interface which prepared students for developing their CS projects on the SNAP! IDE</li>
 </ul>

<h4>WEAKNESSES</h4>
<h4>CS4ALL IPC - Weakness</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Teacher feedback is generated external to projects with limited whole class opportunities to provide real time individual feedback to all instructional participants.</li>
  <li>Teacher must tailor lessons and assessments to the varying abilities of students.</li>
  <li>Requires a strong wifi signal to engage in required assessments.</li>
  <li>Unplugged activities require substantial preparedness time and established student management routines.</li>
  <li>Includes limited opportunities for peer to peer learning or peer lead learning.</li>
 </ul>

<h4>CODE.ORG ECC - Weakness</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Collaborative partnerships do not distinguish the contributions of individual student achievement.</li>
  <li>User identification and passwords requirement for logging into accounts can hinder students' accessibility to the platform beyond the classroom. ability to access platform.</li>
  <li>Challenge assessments embedded in the express course may lead to increased frustration.</li>
  <li>Printable assessment accomplishment are generic and undistinguishable.</li>
  <li>Reports generated on student progress are general and do not include pedagogical highlights to support instructional decisions.</li>
  <li>No alignment to NYSED CS Standards.</li>
</ul>

<h3>PART 3</h3>
<h4>COMMENTARY</h4>
<p>From what I garnered after reviewing both curriculums, the CS4ALL stands a bit above the CODE.ORG ECC curriculum because it consists of significantly more opportunities to tailor lessons and assessment to meet the needs of students with varying abilities, to collaborate with colleagues to build cross curricular projects that enhance and illustrates student's CS understandings and capacity and to provide opportunities to apply understanding beyond the classroom, like engaging in CS competitions.</p>

<h3>PART 4</h3>
<h4>POTENTIAL FOR INTEGRATION & REASONING</h4>
<p>I have authored a curriculum tailored to equip my students with solid, enduring understandings and applications of foundational CS principles. I have and continue to dedicate my instructional efforts and focus toward building student connections to CS and CS related subject matter. Many of the resources that are available in the CS4ALL IPC are ones that are already integral and utilized in my instruction, i.e. SCRATCH. I continue to develop my pedagogy by participating in PDs that provide access for resources I can incorporate into my instruction to support student learning and applicable understandings. Regarding the CODE.ORG ECC curriculum, many of the videos are extremely useful in lending student a through yet abbreviated videos that are laden with CS explanations that serve to peak student interest in the subject matter to be covered. Thus in summary both curriculums contain resources that I may incorporate into annual revisions of my present curriculum.</p>
