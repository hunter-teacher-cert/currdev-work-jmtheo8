Directions:
Come up with an idea for a new comptuer science course that you would teach at your current school.
Make sure to include the following:

Course Title: 
Introduction to Creative Coding

General Descripton:
I would like to develop a unit plan for computer science course that introduces students to the 
interface of the p5.js IDE and create experinces, challenges that introduce fundamentals 
of basic programming through studnet centered lab projects that test theirunderstanding or concepts 
and presents challenges to increase creative and academic ownership of instructed concepts in p5.js. 
Moreso p5.js projects could be integrated into and applied ib a cross academic manner.

Target audiance:
8th grade students

Where it fits along with the other courses in your school
This course can be applied across academice areas.
For example it can be used to demonstrate deeper understandinng of core princiles in math via polygon 
development from a static and animated viewpoint.
