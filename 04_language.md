Directions:
Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)

Prompts:

What is the course? (grade level, student experience)
The course is “Introduction to Creative Coding.”
The grade level would be 8th grade.
Student experience would need to be intermediate, with an expectation that students have some experience and exposure to text based programming on accessible IDEs.

The course that was discussed was Processing, however a better fit for my students would be p5.js
What is the language?
The course that was discussed was processing, however a better fit for my students would be p5.js, a language with an accessible learning curve as p5. js is a version of Processing that is based on JavaScript rather than Java.

How does one write & run code in this language?
Code is typed (built) and run on a proprietary IDE.

Rate the complexity of the syntax?
The complexity of the syntax grows as Processing is based in JAVA.
For my students I would rate this language highly complex

Strengths
Creative coding opportunities within Processing allows students to apply their individual creativity to Processing projects.

How would you utilize the strengths in the class?
Students will have the flexibility and accessibility to create Processing projects that exhibit varying skill levels and their inherent creativity

Weaknesses
Students can become frustrated when Processing outputs do not illustrate coded expectations.
May present a steep learning curve for students that are not familiar with text based debugging strategies.   
How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
Though application of strategies that were discussed in our summer methods class, ie scaffolding and differentiated live coding demonstrations.

Why did you select this language for this class?
The language that I think is best for my student population would be p5.js over Processing as JavaScript would be the next step up from my HTML/CSS web design course, thus p5,js would be the better language.
