Technological tools used in the classroom. 

Tool Name:
Popcode.org

General Purpose:
Its general purpose is to serve as an IDE to introduce students to text based HTML5 and CSS3 markup and style languages.

Course Tool Is Used In:
 Popcode is used in my introductory to coding technology class.

How you use it in class.
Popcode is used during live coding demonstrations, as an IDE to build student HTML5 and CSS3 projects and as an assessment tool to gauge student progress.

Why have you selected that tool for that purpose?
I have selected Popcode because it lends students hints to debugging their code in real time with its built in cloud that provides students with hints to errors/mistypes in the development process/code building experiences. This “hint” feature aids with diminishing fatigue and frustration with the debugging process amongst my student population.  


Tool Name:
Glitch.com

General Purpose:
Its general purpose is to serve as an IDE to introduce intermediate students to text based HTML5 and CSS3 markup and style languages on an IDE that contains files and attributes common to similar web design IDE sites.

Course Tool Is Used In:
Glitch is used in my code based technology class.

How you use it in class.
Glitch is used during live coding demonstrations, as an IDE to build student HTML5 and CSS3 projects, as a collaborative space for student teams to build and develop their ideas and as an assessment tool to gauge student progress.

Why have you selected that tool for that purpose?
I have selected Glitch because it lends students an interface that is close to that of other IDEs with a benefit of a real time build display that allows students to view their HTML5 and CSS3 markup and style, a feature that aids with diminishing fatigue and frustration with the debugging process amongst my student population. Furthermore, HTML5 is built in an index file while CSS3 is built in a style.css files mimikin industry scale file organization.
